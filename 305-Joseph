/* 305 - JOSEPH
 * The Joseph’s problem is notoriously known.
 * For those who are not familiar with the original problem:
 * from among n people, numbered 1, 2, ...,n, standing in circle every m-th is going to be executed and
 * only the life of the last remaining person will be saved.
 * Joseph was smart enough to choose the position of the last remaining person, thus saving his life
 * to give us the message about the incident.
 * For example when n = 6 and m = 5 then the people will be executed in the order 5, 4, 6, 2, 3 and 1 will be saved.
 * Suppose that there are k good guys and k bad guys.
 * In the circle the first k are good guys and the last k bad guys.
 * You have to determine such minimal m that all the bad guys will be executed before the first good guy. */

/* INPUT:
 * The input file consists of separate lines containing k.
 * The last line in the input file contains ‘0’.
 * You can suppose that 0 < k < 14. */

/* OUTPUT:
 * The output file will consist of separate lines containing m corresponding to k in the input file. */
